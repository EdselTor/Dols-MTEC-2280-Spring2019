**This will be due Monday March 18.**

**_Choose to create either a Game OR a branching Story_**: 

This project should be done using Processing.

_If you choose to make a game_, take inspiration from early arcade games such as Pong or Asteroids.  Games are fun to make but have a lot of logic necessary to make them work.  Your game should have a clear set of rules, point system, a goal, and a way to pause, resume, or restart.

_If you chose to make a story_, look to the structure of small narrative games or 'choose your own adventure' type models.  Your game should have a beginning, middle, and end with a cohesive story line or theme.  Stories should start with one beginning, but branch into a number of potential paths, conflicts, journeys, and resolutions for the user/reader to enjoy.

We will discuss specifics and requirements as we develop our individual projects.

**Schedule**

March 4: Come to class with a idea or a few inspriations which you would like to work with.  Decide by now whether or not you will do a Game or a Story.
